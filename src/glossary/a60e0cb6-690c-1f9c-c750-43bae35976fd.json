  "term": "Softmax function",
  "definition": "a function of the form f(xi)=exp(xi)/sum(exp(x)) where the sum is taken over a set of x. Softmax is used at different layers (often at the output layer) of artificial neural networks to predict classifications for inputs to those layers.\nThe softmax function calculates the probabilities distribution of the event xi over ‘n’ different events. In general sense, this function calculates the probabilities of each target class over all possible target classes. The calculated probabilities are helpful for predicting that the target class is represented in the inputs.\n\nThe main advantage of using Softmax is the output probabilities range. The range will 0 to 1, and the sum of all the probabilities will be equal to one. If the softmax function used for multi-classification model it returns the probabilities of each class and the target class will have the high probability.\n\nThe formula computes the exponential (e-power) of the given input value and the sum of exponential values of all the values in the inputs. Then the ratio of the exponential of the input value and the sum of exponential values is the output of the softmax function."
