<p>An&nbsp;input neuron&nbsp;has no predecessor but serves as input interface for the whole network. Similarly an&nbsp;output neuron&nbsp;has no successor and thus serves as output interface of the whole network.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;network&nbsp;includes connections, each connection transferring the output of a neuron in one layer to the input of a neuron in a next layer. Each connection carries an input x and is assigned a weight w.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;learning rule&nbsp;is a rule or an algorithm which modifies the parameters of the neural network, in order for a given input to the network to produce a favored output. This&nbsp;learning process typically involves modifying the weights and thresholds of the neurons and connections within the network.</p>
