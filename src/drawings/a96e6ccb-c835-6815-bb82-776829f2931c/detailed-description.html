Each connection, like the&nbsp;synapses&nbsp;in a biological&nbsp;brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.

<p>In common implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function (the activation function) of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called 'edges' or axons. Artificial neurons and edges typically have a&nbsp;weight&nbsp;that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold (trigger threshold) such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the
